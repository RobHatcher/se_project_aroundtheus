# Project 3: Around The U.S. by Robert Hatcher

**Description**

Project 3 was an opportunity for me to use all the new knowledge I had aquired and apply it to a blank slate on VS.Code. I was able to use newly learned properties such as, Display: Grid, and Media Queries to adjust the design of the site according to the screen size. Each media querie has its own unique features that allows the structure of the website stay consistent and clean as the screen size changes.

**Improvements**

List of improvements: - Add navigation bar - Add descriptions for photos - Add GPS map for locations - Add hashtags for similar posts
